# Campus Connect
<p align="justify">
In todayâ€™s digital age, students need a common space to share knowledge, stay updated on events, and learn from real experiences. <b>Campus Connect</b> bridges that gap by offering a platform where students can log in and access multiple resources. They can share notes, get updates on campus events, listen to expert podcasts, and learn from seniors' placement journeys. The platform allows content uploads in the form of PDFs, images, and media files. With easy-to-use forms and organized layouts, it supports collaborative learning and builds a stronger campus network.
Campus Connect is an all-in-one web platform designed to foster student engagement and learning by providing centralized access to notes sharing, event updates, podcasts, and placement talks. The application begins with a welcome page for login or new user signup, followed by a navigation bar for smooth access to features. Users can upload PDFs, images, audio, and videos to share valuable academic and career-related content. Each section displays content on the same page after posting, making the experience seamless. This platform helps students stay informed, prepared, and connected with campus life and beyond.
